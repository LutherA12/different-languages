Generally larger inner city and urban areas see this spoken dialect the most.</li><br><li>Cajun English: spoken mostly in deep southern Louisiana. Very heavily influenced by Louisiana French, Cajun English is unmistakable as it sounds almost like a 50/50 mixture of French and English. Or more specifically, English words with a very heavy American/French accent.</li><br><li>Latino English: This type of English has 3 vernaculars:<br><br><ul><li>Chicano English or Mexican American</li><li>Miami English</li><li>New York Latino English</li><br></ul></li><li>Pennslyvania Dutch English: spoken mostly in Pennslyvania, Ohio, Indiana and even Canada!<br><br></li><li>Yeshivish English: spoken by Yeshiva students and other Jewish folks with a cultural connection to the Orthodox Yeshiva world.<br><br></li><li>Northern American English: spoken by peoples on the northeastern side of the US (most of the Great Lakes region, northern Ohio, northern Illinois, southern Michigan, southern Wisconsin)<br><br></li><li>New England English: split into 4 dialects:<br><br><ul><li>Eastern New England (Boston and Maine)</li><li>Rhode Island English</li><li>Western New England (Connecticut, western Massachusetts, Vermont)</li><li>North Central/Upper Midwestern (North and South Dakota, Minnasota, Northern Wisconsin, Montana)<br><br></li></ul><li>Metropolitian New York English (very distinct accent found in most native born folks from New York)</li><br><li>Southeastern English which has quite a few dialects:<br><br><ul><li>Midland American English (split into North and South midland) North being Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, Central Ohio and South being Oklahoma, Kansas, St. Louis, Georgia, Indiana, and southwest Ohio.</li><li>Hoi Toider English (very rare spoken dialect found in the South Atlantic US, small islands and coastal townships)</li><li>New Orleans English</li><li>Philadelphia and Baltimore English</li><li>Southern American English (split into Southern Appalachian, Texan English and Tennesseean English)<br><br></li></ul></li><li>Western American English with 2 dialects:<br><br><ul><li>California English</li><li>Pacific Northwest English</li></ul><br><li>Western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) English<br><br></li></li></li><li>There are also some near extinct English dialects:<br><br><ul><li>Boontling English (fewer than 100 people still speak this and it is only found in Boonville, Northern California)</li><li>Older Southern American English (spoken by many Caucasian southerners before the American Civil War. Interestingly, much of African American Ebonics/"slang" or "plantation talk" shares common roots with this type of English today)</li><li>Mid-Atlantic/Transatlantic English (this was more of an accent than a dialect, used mostly in the early to mid 1900s and still today in a lot of movies)</li></ul></li><br><li>Finally, there are some hybrid American English based languages:<br><br><ul><li>Afro Seminole Creole (comes in many different types but is still very distinct)</li><li>Spanglish (is exactly what it sounds like, an almost 50/50 mix of Spanish and English</li></ul></li></ul></li><p>That is mostly it for American English dialects, however, each other country in the world has their own dialects of English.
